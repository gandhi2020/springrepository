Design consideration.
1. The UI can be built like that of a CICS application
	List all the transactions with a number against the transaction type
	User provide the transaction type that they want to test as input in a text box.

2. The UI can be built like a regular web-app.
	User will be provided with a drop down menu. Based on what they choose, 
	the data will be used to prepare the transaction.

The drop down list example for this is picked from
http://fruzenshtein.com/spring-mvc-form-select-tag/

locally available form options
<form:option value="01">Balance Enquiry</form:option>
<form:option value="02">Cash withdrawal</form:option>

The option that is worked is based on the example from above website.
